 <summary>A virtual guitar amplifier</summary>
 <description>
   <p>
     Guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on Jack Audio
     Connection Kit.
   </p>
   <p>
     Guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do: as a
     mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed by a main amp
     and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and deliver a processed
     stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the rack with effects from more than
     25 built-in modules including stuff from a simple noise gate to
     brain-slashing modulation f/x like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.
   </p>
   <p>
     Your signal is processed with minimum latency. On any properly set-up
     Linux-system you don't have to wait more than 10ms until your sound is
     processed by guitarix.
   </p>

     <description>
       <p>For this release Damien Zammit from ZamAudio has reworked
       our tube emulation.  This improved beside the overall sound,
       the dynamic responses of the different tube simulations.  Be
       aware please, that this may break your existing presets, but,
       we believe that the improvement in sound is it worse to force
       you to readjust your presets to match the new tube sims.</p>
       <p>Further news are:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Reworked French translation by Olivier Humbert</li>
         <li>Add DC-Blocker on the Input</li>
